This project is about to try to clean a dataset.
Data set:
The data is from the Kaggle web site about some information about the Steam web site for video games.
Description of the problems:
In this data set, I found 15 missing values in two columns. I tried to handle it, and I changed the column values of such columns.
I also did the visualization of some of them. 
All this work was done using a lot of libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Check out the code to discover the work.
Thank you!
